# Some contributions to the LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm

The https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm[LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm]
is already a great toolchain.  But why not make your life easier with the following additional libraries: 

* link:profiling[profiling] via semihosting
* link:rtt[RTT support] for both console I/O and SystemView

Note that the contributed libraries are built per default.  For detailed build instructions
of the toolchain see https://github.com/rgrr/playground/tree/main/tools/build-llvm[here].
